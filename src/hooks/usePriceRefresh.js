// Automatic price refresh: keeps the TASE/Yahoo prices on the stock arrays
// up to date, unless the user is mid-edit or mid-add.
//
// This hook is the client half of the "the app must render instantly and
// fill in prices afterwards" requirement. Two things make that work:
//
// 1. Nothing here blocks rendering. The tables draw immediately from the
//    prices already persisted with the portfolio (the local snapshot), and
//    this hook only ever *replaces* those values once fresher ones arrive.
//    A refresh that fails, or is still in flight, leaves the last known
//    prices on screen - it never blanks them or holds up a paint.
//
// 2. The first refresh fires immediately on mount instead of waiting a
//    whole polling interval. Previously the first live prices could not
//    arrive until 10s after load no matter how fast the server answered.
//
// Both markets are fetched in ONE batched request each (see
// api/stockPrices.js), rather than one request per unique symbol, and the
// two batches run concurrently.
//
// The hook reports its progress (`refreshing`, `lastRefreshAt`,
// `hasLoadedLivePrices`) so the UI can show a loading indicator / skeleton
// over the price columns while the first cycle is still running, instead of
// silently showing stale numbers as if they were live.
