// "What was my portfolio worth in ILS on date X?" - reconstructs a
// historical value from real historical closing prices, instead of
// relying on a saved snapshot existing for that exact date. Each
// holding's price on the requested date is the most recent trading-day
// close on or before it (carried forward over weekends/holidays) -
// reusing alignBenchmarkClosesToDates (benchmarkComparison.js) per
// holding instead of reimplementing the same carry-forward logic here.
//
// Quantity held as of a date is the sum of lots whose purchaseDate is on
// or before that date - this app has no sell/lot-reduction model (only
// additions), so "as of date X" can only ever include lots that existed
// by then. A lot added after date X simply isn't counted yet, which is
// the correct behavior, not a limitation to work around.
//
// Non-traded accounts (provident funds, money-market funds, current
// accounts, bank savings funds) have no historical close to look up, so
// they are reconstructed from their own ledgers instead - see
// ledgerAccountHistory.js and bankSavingsFund.js. They're opt-in per call:
// pass them and they're included, leave them out and the series covers the
// traded holdings only.
//
// WHICH HOLDINGS TO PASS IS THE CALLER'S DECISION, AND IT IS A REAL ONE.
//
// This module values whatever it is given; it has no opinion about what a
// performance figure should cover. utils/portfolioSegments.js holds that
// opinion, and the performance chart asks it: EQUITIES ONLY by default,
// optionally narrowed to one market.
//
// The reason is that the non-equity accounts do not move with the market
// but do sit in both the numerator and the denominator of every sub-period,
// so including them pulls each percentage toward zero. A holding that
// doubled beside an equal balance of idle cash measures +50%, and the
// investor learns nothing about their stock picking. Passing a subset here
// is what keeps the two questions - "how did my shares do" and "how did my
// net worth do" - separately answerable.

// COST-BASIS ANCHORING ON DAY 0
//
// A lot is worth what was actually paid for it on the day it was bought,
// and the market close only from the next day onwards.
//
// Valuing a lot at that day's CLOSE instead silently invents a gap between
// what the investor put in and what the portfolio is recorded as holding
// the moment they put it in. Everywhere in the middle of a series that gap
// is harmless - the contribution is netted out of the sub-period it lands
// in, so the difference between the execution price and the close shows up
// as the gain it is. But at the very START of a series there is no earlier
// point to measure from: the curve simply begins at the close-based value,
// and the entire execution difference vanishes. A holding bought at 182
// that the close valued at 32,568 began life "worth" 32,568, and the
// 182 -> 32,568 move was never anybody's return.
//
// Anchoring day 0 to the cost basis closes that hole, and for an ordinary
// intraday fill - where execution differs from the close by a fraction of
// a percent - it is what makes execution quality part of the measured
// performance rather than a rounding error the engine discards.
//
// Applied PER LOT, not per symbol: on any given date a symbol can hold
// lots bought years ago (market close) alongside one bought that very
// morning (cost basis), and the two have to be valued differently in the
// same sum.
// True only for a lot bought on this exact date AND carrying a usable cost
// basis.
//
// The second half matters: "bought today" and "we know what was paid" are
// different facts. A lot with no purchase price (or a zero one) has no cost
// basis to anchor to, and valuing it at zero would assert the position was
// worth nothing on the day it was opened - then show the full close value
// appearing out of nowhere the next day, as a gain, with no contribution
// to net it against. portfolioCashFlows.js drops a zero-amount flow for
// exactly the same reason, so the two stay consistent: no recorded cost,
