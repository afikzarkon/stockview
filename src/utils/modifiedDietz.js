// Modified Dietz return: a time-weighted approximation of investment
// performance over a period that had external cash flows (deposits,
// withdrawals, new purchases) partway through - so a mid-period deposit
// isn't counted as investment growth, and the closer to the end of the
// period a cash flow landed, the less "credit"/"blame" it gets for the
// period's overall % change. This is the standard industry approximation
// (see e.g. the GIPS performance-measurement standards) used whenever daily
// valuations aren't available - only the beginning/ending value and the
// dated list of flows in between are needed.
//
// R = (EMV - BMV - CF) / (BMV + Σ CF_i * w_i)
//   EMV / BMV = ending / beginning market value
//   CF_i      = each external cash flow (+ contribution, - withdrawal)
//   w_i       = (periodEnd - date_i) / (periodEnd - periodStart) - the
//               fraction of the period that flow's money was NOT yet
//               invested (a flow on day 1 of the period gets weight ~1, a
//               flow on the very last day gets weight ~0)
//
// Not a full daily time-weighted return (that needs a valuation on every
// cash-flow date, which this app doesn't have) - this is the best
// approximation achievable from month-start/month-end checkpoints plus a
// dated list of flows, and is what calculatePensionPeriodReturn's simpler
// (non-time-weighted) sibling in portfolioMath.js was already approximating
// less precisely for a single pension fund's own previous/current update.
