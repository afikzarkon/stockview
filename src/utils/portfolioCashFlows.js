// Every dated external cash flow into or out of the portfolio, drawn from
// the records the user already keeps in the main tables.
//
// "External" means money crossing the portfolio's boundary - a deposit, a
// withdrawal, or the cash spent buying a new position. It is NOT investment
// performance, and it is exactly what has to be netted out before a
// "return" figure means anything: a portfolio that went from ₪100k to
// ₪150k because ₪50k was paid into it did not grow 50%, it grew 0%.
//
// Sources, all of them already maintained elsewhere in the app:
//   * stock purchase lots  - each lot's cost at its purchase date
//                            (an American lot's cost is converted to ILS
//                            at the rate actually paid, matching how
//                            totalPurchaseILS is computed everywhere else)
//   * provident funds      - the dated deposit ledger
//   * bank savings funds   - the dated deposit ledger
//   * money-market funds   - the dated deposit ledger
//
// LIMITATION, stated rather than hidden: this app has no sell/withdrawal
// ledger, so the automatic side only ever sees money going IN. A sale or a
// withdrawal is invisible here and would still read as a fall in value,
// i.e. as a loss. That is why the monthly tracker keeps a manual net-flow
// field for the liquid accounts, and why a current account's balance
// changes are not treated as flows at all (see below).

// read as the portfolio suddenly earning ₪20,000.
