  // A donut whose slices are only identified in a legend beside it makes
  // the reader match six colours to six rows before they can read
  // anything. The callout puts all three facts on the slice's own leader
  // line instead - what it is, what it is worth, and what share of the
  // total that is - so the chart answers "what is the big one, and how
  // much is in it?" without a lookup.
  //
  // Two lines rather than one run-on string: the name is what identifies
  // the slice and the amount is what quantifies it, and at this size a
  // single line of all three runs past the margin the callouts live in.
  //
  // The leader is drawn here rather than left to recharts' own labelLine,
  // because that line stops at the slice's edge and the text sits further
  // out - leaving a gap the reader has to bridge on charts with several
  // small slices. This one runs from the slice to an elbow and then
  // horizontally into the text it belongs to, so which label belongs to
  // which slice is never in question.
  //
  // Slices under 3% are left unlabelled: below that the callouts collide
  // with each other and the chart becomes less readable, not more. Those
  // remain identifiable in the legend underneath, which is why it stays.
  //
  // Neighbouring labels are also spread apart vertically (see
  // utils/pieCalloutLayout.js): several small slices next to each other
  // would otherwise put their labels at nearly the same height on the rail,
  // printed through one another. That needs every slice's position, not
  // just this one's, which is why this is a factory over the chart's values
  // rather than a plain renderer.
  //
  // Long names wrap onto more lines instead of running off the chart: on a
