// which jsPDF's dependency chain (fast-png -> iobuffer) references at
// import time - so any jsdom-environment test that renders a component
// importing exportReport.js (even indirectly, e.g. HomeView.js) would
// otherwise fail with "TextEncoder is not defined" before the test body
// even runs. Node has always had these globally; just re-expose them.

// requires to measure its container - any test rendering a recharts chart
// (StockResearchView's RadarChart, PortfolioAnalysisView's charts, ...)
// would otherwise fail with "ResizeObserver is not defined" during mount.
// A no-op stub is enough since jsdom has no real layout engine to observe
// anyway - tests don't depend on actual resize behavior.
